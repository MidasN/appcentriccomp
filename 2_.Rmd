Q4-Q7 are questions regarding soft on different devices
DF with all the software items

```{r}

merged = merged[!is.na(merged$a2), ] %>% # removing NA's from the a column
  dplyr::rename(a = a2) %>% # FIXME: loosing the information about the device used
  dplyr::select(-RecordNo, -q)

pre_dist =
  merged %>%
  gather(key, val, Occupation) %>%
  group_by(a, val) %>%
  tally() %>%
  spread(val, n, fill = 0)

# TODO: clean the data https://github.com/mlampros/fuzzywuzzyR

```

mds on 100/200 pieces of software OR everything with frequency above 4/5
Using software_aggregated (sorted by items frequencies) for choosing labels

```{r}


pre_dist_100 =
  merged %>%
  dplyr::filter(a %in% software_aggregated$a2[1:100]) %>%
  gather(key, val, Occupation) %>%
  group_by(a, val) %>%
  tally() %>%
  spread(val, n, fill = 0)

pre_dist_200 =
  merged %>%
  dplyr::filter(a %in% software_aggregated$a2[1:200]) %>%
  gather(key, val, Occupation) %>%
  group_by(a, val) %>%
  tally() %>%
  spread(val, n, fill = 0)


```


Labels to put on the map

```{r}

labels_to_select = software_aggregated$a2[1:115]

```

MDS

```{r}

set.seed(33)

source("./functions.R")

with(dev.new(), mds_n_plot(pre_dist, "canberra", labels_to_select, 6))

with(dev.new(), mds_n_plot(pre_dist_100, "canberra", labels_to_select, 6))

with(dev.new(), mds_n_plot(pre_dist_200, "canberra", labels_to_select, 6))
